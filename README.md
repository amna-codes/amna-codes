# Amna Ghaffar

An IT graduate with a CGPA of 3.99. My academic and project work is focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning applications, particularly in healthcare and real-world problem domains.

## Focus Areas
- Deep Learning (CNNs, PyTorch)
- Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing
- Backend Development (Flask, REST APIs)
- Research in AI & Applied ML

## Selected Projects

### Brain Tumor Detection System  
Developed a deep learning model using PyTorch for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. Integrated the model into a Flask-based web interface. Focus areas: CNN architecture tuning, image preprocessing, deployment.

### Budget Tracker Web App  
Built a dynamic expense tracking tool using JavaScript and Chart.js. Features category-wise visualization, total tracking, and responsive UI.

### To-Do List Application  
Task management interface with core CRUD operations. Designed with simplicity and user interaction in focus.
